# Greenland 🌿

## ❔ | What is it?
**Greenland** is a **personal** project that aim to reduce energy consumption of Hyprland setups by doing a few things:

1. Monitor what workspace you are on, adjusting the CPU Frequency preset based on the ID
2. Monitor your cursor position, activating hibernation after 30 minutes if no updates were detected

## 🚨 | Important
**Greenland** is made entirely for my own use-case and is **not** designed for non-Hyprland and non-systemd setups.

Feature requests and PRs are welcome, but don't keep your hopes up. If **Greenland** works for you, great! If not, then you're free to modify it as long as you follow the license.
